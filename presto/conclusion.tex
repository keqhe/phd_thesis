\section{Summary}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we present Presto: a near uniform sub-flow distributed load balancing scheme
that can near optimally load balance the network at fast networking speeds.
Our scheme makes a few changes to the hypervisor soft-edge (vSwitch and GRO)
and does not require any modifications to the transport layer or network hardware, making
the bar for deployment lower. 
%Working at fast networking speeds poses many challenges,
Presto is explicitly designed to load balance the network at fine granularities
and deal with reordering without imposing much overhead on hosts. Presto is flexible and can also
deal with failures and asymmetry. Finally, we show the performance of Presto can closely track
that of an optimal non-blocking switch, meaning elephant throughputs remain high while the tail
latencies of mice flow completion times do not grow due to congestion.
