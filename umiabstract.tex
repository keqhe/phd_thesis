% The margincheck option flags lines which overflow their hbox with a black
%  box at the end of the line.  This usually (but not always) indicates a
%  margin violation on the right margin.  Left margin violations aren't
%  indicated and if the margin violation is large enough, there isn't room
%  for the black box to be visiable.  
%
% This option can be also used in conjunction with the msthesis option.

% The msthesis option changes the page margins from 1" all around
% (the PhD format) to 1.25" left and 1" remaining margins (MS format).
% The defaults for degree and thesis are changed to be MS and thesis.
% These defaults can be overridden if the margins for the MS thesis
% are desired for other documents.

%  The package times is used to change the fonts to Times Roman; however
%    because the times typewriter font looks odd, the original LaTeX
%    Computer Modern font is kept for the typewriter font using
%      \renewcommand{\ttdefault}{cmtt}
%    Note that Times Roman is a PostScript font and therefore, the document
%    cannot be correctly viewed from the *.dvi file.  It should be converted
%    to a *.ps file first and then viewed with a PostScript previewer...

%========================================================================
%  Draft Control Commands:
%========================================================================
%
% \psdraft causes the \psfig or \epsfig commands to draw a box and label
% the box with the postscript file name instead of reading in the full
% postscript figure.  This can save time and toner when printing drafts.
%
%\psdraft
%
%
% \psfull causes the inclusion of the postscript figures.
%\psfull
%
%
%\pagestyle{thesisdraft} causes the footer text to become:
% DRAFT: Do Not Distribute        <time><Date>        <input file name>
%
%\pagestyle{thesisdraft}
%
%\pagestyle{thesis} causes the header and footers to be the correct format
%
%\pagestyle{thesis}
%
%
%  The page margins can be marked with a post-script box using the
%  \draftmargins command.  This command uses dvips's end-of-page hook
%  This is only visible in the *.ps file (NOT the *.dvi file)!
%
%\draftmargins
%
%
%  The word ``DRAFT'' can be diagonally printed across the page using

%  hook.  This is only visible in the *.ps file (NOT the *.dvi file)!

\begin{umiabstract}

Cloud outage can result in bad user experiences and revenue loss. However, few of existing network diagnostic solutions are designed specifically for cloud networks. They fall short in three aspects: (1) the unclarified way to distinguish problems in tenantsâ€™ virtual networks and the provider's infrastructure increases the time and costs that are spent on the interaction between the two roles. (2) For cloud tenants, leveraging rudimentary tools inside virtual networks to diagnose distributed systems is difficult, where the diagnosis depends heavily on experience which is not always feasible. (3) For the cloud provider, new trends that increase the complexity of the infrastructure causes new problems arising, which requires new diagnostic tools to cover this range.

We design two systems for cloud network diagnosis: (A) \emph{VND: a Virtual Network Diagnostic Service.} VND is a service offered by the provider to its tenants. A tenant could use VND's interfaces to collect, parse and query its packet traces, and then conduct diagnosis. The trace collection interface keeps cloud's abstraction, and trace parse and query interfaces simplify the tenant's diagnostic operations. We show that several typical network diagnostic solutions can be easily implemented using VND. We also measure VND's overhead and show its feasibility. (B) \emph{PerfSight: Performance Diagnosis for Software Data Planes.} The increasing amount of software in modern network data planes leads to at least three new classes of performance problems: bottlenecks, contentions and bugs. We propose PerfSight to target these problems. PerfSight instruments the software data plane, and gathers and analyzes basic statistics comprehensively. We obtained two key insights by running PerfSight: (1) packet drop is the best indicator of bottlenecks, and location of packet drop can reveal physical resources in contention; (2) basic statistics define software middlebox's states, which propagate in the network following certain patterns. These patterns can be used to infer the root-cause middlebox with performance bugs. Our evaluation shows PerfSight introduces little overhead to the existing system, and thus it is feasible to deploy.

Together, we believe VND and PerfSight provide diagnostic solutions to both tenants and the provider. They form an integral basis for cloud network diagnosis.
