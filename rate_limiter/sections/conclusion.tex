\section{Summary} 
\label{rate-limiter:sec:conclusion} 

A lot of recent work has been focusing on solving in network latency in datacenter networks.
In this paper, we focus on a less explored topic \textemdash\xspace latency
increase caused by rate limiters on the end-host.
We show that latency can be increased by an order of magnitude
by the rate limiters in cloud networks,
and simply extending ECN into rate limiters is not sufficient.
To this end, we propose two techniques \textemdash\xspace~\dem{} and~\spring{} to improve the performance of rate limiters.
Our experiment results demonstrate that~\dem{} and~\spring{} enabled
rate limiters can achieve high (and stable) throughput and low latency.
