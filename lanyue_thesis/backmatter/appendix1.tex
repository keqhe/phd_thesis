\section{Source Code}
\label{sec-appendix-source}

We strongly believe that releasing research prototypes helps in
reproducing results, building on prior research, and increasing
impact. To this end, we have made both the major systems developed as
part of this dissertation work publicly available.

The source code for NoFS can be obtained at: \hspace*{-0pt}\texttt{
  \url{http://www.cs.wisc.edu/adsl/Software/nofs}}. The source code
for OptFS can be obtained at: \hspace*{-0pt}\texttt{
  \url{http://www.cs.wisc.edu/adsl/Software/optfs}}. To further aid
researchers interested in OptFS, we have also released virtual-machine
images with the file system (and modified kernel) installed: users
only need a hypervisor such as VirtualBox installed to try out OptFS.
