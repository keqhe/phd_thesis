\section{Conclusion}

This dissertation is mainly composed of three closely related research projects --- traffic 
load balancing for datacenter networks, virtualized congestion control for multi-tenant 
clouds and low latency software rate limiters for cloud networks. All these projects 
leverage the flexibility and high programmability of software-defined network 
edge (i.e., end-host networking) to improve network performance for datacenter networks. 
As far as we know, the techniques and mechanisms proposed in this dissertation are novel and original. 
We believe they  will be valuable to the computer networking research community. 
In the following, we provide a short conclusion for each work in turn.
