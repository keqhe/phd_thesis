Multi-tenant datacenters are successful today because they
allow tenants to seamlessly port their workloads, applications and services
to the cloud. Virtual Machine (VM) technology plays an integral role in this success
by enabling a diverse set of operating systems,
configurations and software to be run on a unified underlying framework. This
flexiblity, however, comes at the cost of dealing with out-dated, inefficient, or 
misconfigured TCP stacks implemented in the VMs. This paper investigates if
datacenter administrators can take back control of the VM's TCP congestion control
algorithm {\em without} making any changes to the VM or network hardware.
We propose a scheme, called~\acdc{} TCP, that exerts a fine-grained
level of control over arbitrary tenant TCP stacks by enforcing per-flow congestion
control in the vSwitch. Our scheme is light-weight, flexible, scalable and 
can effectively enforce and police an administrator-defined congestion control algorithm
over a variety of VM TCP stacks.
