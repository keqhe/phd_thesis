\section{Summary}
Today's datacenters host a variety of VMs (virtual machines) in order to
support a diverse set of tenant services. Datacenter operators
typically invest significant resources in optimizing their network fabric,
but they cannot control one of the most important components of 
avoiding congestion: TCP's congestion control algorithm in the VM. In this chapter,
we present a technology that allows administrators to regain control over arbitrary tenant TCP stacks by enforcing congestion
control in the vSwitch. Our scheme, called~\acdc{} TCP, requires no 
changes to VMs or network hardware. Our approach is scalable, light-weight,
flexible and provides a policing mechanism to deal with non-conforming flows.
In our evaluation the CPU overhead is less than~\crs{one percentage point} and our scheme 
is shown to effectively enforce an administrator-defined congestion control
algorithm over a variety of tenant TCP stacks.
