\section{Conclusion}
Today's datacenters host a variety of virtual machines (VMs) in order to
support a diverse set of tenant services. Datacenter operators
typically invest significant resources in optimizing their network fabric,
but they cannot control one of the most important components of 
avoiding congestion: TCP's congestion control algorithm in the VM. In this paper,
we present a technology that allows administrators to exert a fine-grained
level of control over arbitrary tenant TCP stacks by enforcing congestion
control in the vSwitch. Our scheme, called~\acdc{} TCP, requires no 
changes to VMs or network hardware. We show it is scalable, light-weight
and effectively enforces an adminstrator-defined congestion control
algorithm on tenant TCP stacks.
