\section{Closing Words}
\label{sec-conc-closing}

Digital data is universal and essential in many aspects of our
lives and businesses. With the increasing amount of data generated and
the rise of new hardware, accessing data both reliably and efficiently
become critical for modern storage systems.  

In this dissertation, we began our journey with a comprehensive study
of Linux file systems evolution, to better understand the reliability
and performance problems that plague existing systems for
decades. Then, we demonstrated that physical separation of fundamental 
data structures in file systems and key-value stores can provide
isolated reliability and significantly better performance.  This is
extremely important for our changing storage world, which becomes
virtualized, multi-tenant and failure-prone. We hope that this
dissertation can serve as a simple but detailed example for
researchers and system builders to rethink the fundamental data
layouts and I/O patterns of existing systems, leverage past valuable
experiences, and embrace new hardware and optimization for a better 
next generation storage system.
