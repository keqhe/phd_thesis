presto has two modes , ecmp and shadow
this micro test tries to show how different they are

topology: 2 layer clos, 4 sender , 4 receiver, 4 paths
nuttcp, over 10 seconds per run, 20 runs
sockperf, 100 msec interval, 20 runs
 
in terms of tput :

arly188:compare_ecmp_shadow hek$ cat presto_ecmp_1/run00*/dcn* |grep RTT | awk '{s+=$7}END{print s/NR}'
9307.32

%%%%NOTE this following is incorrect, it seems,
arly188:compare_ecmp_shadow hek$ cat presto_shadow_1/run00*/dcn* |grep RTT | awk '{s+=$7}END{print s/NR}'
9273.15

in terms of latency (RTT via sockperf). see figure
