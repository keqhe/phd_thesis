\subsection{Incremental FSCK in the Background}
\label{sec-related-fsck}

NoFS performs the checks done by fsck incrementally in the background.
There have been previous work that modified fsck in a similar manner.
McKusick's background fsck~\cite{McKusick02-BackgroundFsck} could
repair simple inconsistencies such as lost resources by running fsck
on snapshots of a running system.
Chunkfs~\cite{HensonEtAl06-ChunkFSlocal} is similar to NoFS, providing
incremental, online file-system checking. Chunkfs differs from NoFS in
that the minimal unit of checking is a chunk whereas it is a single
file or block in NoFS. Chunkfs does not offer online repair of the
file system, while it is possible in NoFS, due to backpointers and
non-persistent allocation structures.
