\section{Crash Recovery}
\label{sec-related-crash}

Designing systems to recover safely after crashes has been the focus
of systems researchers for many years. We first describe how databases
provided crash consistency, and then explain how file systems and
applications built on top of these techniques to build crash
consistency protocols.

\vspace{0.1in} \noindent \textbf{Crash Recovery in Databases}. The
database community pioneered the transaction
abstraction~\cite{Gray81-TransactionConcept, grayetal81,
  MohanEtAl92-Aries} for atomic updates and introduced two techniques
to optimize how transactions are persisted: logging and
checkpointing~\cite{gray1978notes, haerder1983principles,
  MohanEtAl92-Aries}, and group commit~\cite{DewittEtAl84-MemoryDB,
  gawlick1985varieties, MohanEtAl92-Aries}. Mohan \etal\ brought these
techniques together in the ARIES algorithm~\cite{MohanEtAl92-Aries}
that has been implemented in a number of industrial and research
systems~\cite{chang19882, date1989guide, haskin1988recovery,
  schwarz1986extensibility, carey1986object, dewitt1990gamma,
  satyanarayanan1994lightweight}.
