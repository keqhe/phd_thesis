###################  10-19 update  #################
This folder contains data of two figures witch titled "RTT-CDF by two rate limiters and one iperf flow". xlabel is "RTT", ylabel is "CDF". xrange is 0:4000,xitcs is 1000. yrange is 0:100, ytics is 10. The key is "min=xG"
first firgure is drawed from sockperf1_2G.log to sockperf1_5G.log(sockperf1_baseline.log included).
second firgure is drawed from sockperf2_2G.log to sockperf2_5G.log(sockperf2_baseline.log included).

the data file witch named iperf* and sockperf*.log is measured for two rate-limiters and only one iperf flow on per line
