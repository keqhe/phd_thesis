Pursuing a Ph.D. degree is one of my childhood dreams. 
Now I am finishing my Ph.D. study. I still remember the day in August 2012 when I left 
Beijing and landed Seattle. That was the first time I had been to 
a different country. Then I came to Madison to start my Ph.D. journey. 
5 years have passed, I owe a lot to the people who help me in this journey. 

First, I would like to thank my advisor, Professor Aditya Akella for 
his help in my research and life. Aditya helps me identify interesting and 
important research problems. Finding research directions is not easy for new 
graduate students. When I just started my Ph.D., I was not sure what I was going to do 
and just read papers here and there. Aditya guides to explore the correct directions. 
Besides pointing out promising research directions, Aditya also teaches me the 
attitude of conducting solid research. Now I feel the attitude is even more 
important than the research itself. Aditya also gives me a lot of freedom in doing 
research in these 5 years. I feel lucky to have Aditya as my Ph.D. advisor.

Second, I need to thank Professor Suman Banerjee, Dr. Eric Rozner, 
Professor Mike Swift, and Professor Xinyu Zhang for being my committee members. 
I really appreciate their time in reading my Ph.D. thesis and give me constructive 
suggestions to help improve the quality of this thesis. Professor Suman Banerjee 
and Professor Mike Swift also served on my preliminary examination committee in 2016. 
Their questions and feedback in my prelim examination greatly helped me 
define the scope of this thesis.

I am fortunate to work with all of my fantastic mentors and collaborators during my Ph.D. study. 
I would like to thank Professor Thomas Ristenpart. Tom helped me a lot on my first project, 
which was published in the ACM Internet Measurement Conference 2013. He is an amazing 
person and very humorous. I still remember the winter nights when we worked together for 
paper deadlines. 
I also want to thank Eric Rozner, Kanak Agarwal, Yu (Jason) Gu, Wes Felter, and 
John Carter at IBM Research, the Austin Research Laboratory. They helped me write papers, 
conducted experiments and even debug code with me. I spent two summers in Austin, Texas 
(in 2015 and 2016 respectively). Austin was such a great place to live and work --- I 
remember the weather was extremely nice and we went out searching for delicious food 
together. I also want to thank Radhika Mysore, Pavan Konanki, Junlan Zhou, and Rui Wang 
at Google. I spent nearly 7 months at Mountain View, California. Radhika and Pavan 
discussed project ideas with me almost every week and helped review my code. 
Junlan and Rui helped me build a cool tool to analyze datacenter network performance. 
It was a really nice experience to work with them. I also need to thank Marina 
Thottan and Li Erran Li at Bell Labs. The summer at Bell Labs was joyful and that 
was my first internship. I want to thank all my collaborators in the research projects 
I worked on at UW-Madison: Sourav Das, Alexis Fisher, Aaron Gember-Jacobson, 
Junaid Khalid, Chaithan Prakash, Liang Wang, and Wenfei Wu. 


I also want to thank my peers, friends and labmates at UW-Madison: Yizheng Chen, 
Ram Durairajan, Soudeh Ghorbani, Robert Grandl, Lei Kang, Yanfang Le, 
Xiujun Li, Guangyu Liu, Peng Liu, Lanyue Lu, Bozhao Qi, Shan-Hsiang Shen, 
Brent Stephens, Meenakshi Syamkumar, David Tran-Lam, Raajay Vishwanathan, 
Suli Yang, Yan Zhai, Tan Zhang, Xuan Zhang, and Shengqi Zhu. 
With them, life at Madison becomes more colorful.

Finally, I thank all my family members: my father, mother, brother, 
sister-in-law and my lovely nephew and niece. My nephew was born just before 
I started my Ph.D. study. While I am doing my Ph.D., he grows up to be 
an adorable boy. My niece was born when I was in my fourth year in Madison, and 
I have not had the chance to see her in person till now. When I write this thesis, 
I also recall my hometown, my childhood, the cold winter mornings when I went 
to elementary schools, the Spring Festivals when our family members gathered together. 
My parents always cook delicious food for me when I get home or leave for school. 
They stay with me and support me no matter whether I succeed or fail. Thank you for your love!
